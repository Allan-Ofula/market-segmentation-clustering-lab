    "**Interpretation:**\n",
    "- An Adjusted Rand Score of 0.2352 indicates that the clustering is better than random. It shows some alignment with the actual class labels, suggesting partial success in separating the customer segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Did PCA affect performance?**\n",
    "- Yes — but negatively in this case. After applying PCA, the Adjusted Rand Score dropped, meaning that dimensionality reduction likely removed important structure from the data that was helping KMeans distinguish between clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best number of components:**\n",
    "- The best performance came from using the full scaled dataset without PCA. This suggests that the original features (even if high-dimensional) held valuable information that PCA compressed away.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "- PCA is a linear method and may discard nonlinear patterns essential for segmentation. Also, since the dataset has only 6 features, reducing it further might remove critical variance that helps define the cluster boundaries.\n",

    "- HAC struggled overall to find meaningful clusters in this dataset compared to k-means.\n",
    "- Scaling the features improved performance by reducing the bias introduced by large-scale features.\n",
    "- PCA further enhanced performance, possibly by removing noise and collinear dimensions, allowing HAC to better detect natural groupings.\n",
